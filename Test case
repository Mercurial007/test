**Tools**
Tools to use: minikube, not hosted k8s.

**Objective**
The idea of test is to show your ability to run databases and microservices applications in kubernetes.

Create an application that connects to a database, reads some data and returns this data upon HTTP request.
This can be a simple web app which reads a 'hello world' string from mysql database.
Run a database app. Data volume should be persistent.
Application from step 1 needs to discover database from step 2 using kubernetes native features.
Database credentials should NOT be hardcoded in application or helm chart code.
Application should be accessible from the outside of kubernetes.
Create a helm chart which implements all these steps

**Solution**
Provide a link to repository which has:

application code
helm chart
docker files 
readme

**How it will be tested**
We expect a readme which lists all the required commands to run your app locally in minicube.
We start minucube and access the application from a browser.

**Time constraint**
7 days
